-- Synonyms are useful as a method for
-- implementing nameing and location transparency
-- in distributed database environments.
-- Basically, a synonym can offer a "local"
-- name, while hiding the schema and even the
-- database instance whether local or remote.

-- Create public synonyms for the BeerDB.
-- This has already been executed for you.
-- You should be able to query these tables
-- from your account (so try it out).

CREATE PUBLIC SYNONYM beers FOR beerdb.beers;
CREATE PUBLIC SYNONYM breweries FOR beerdb.breweries;
CREATE PUBLIC SYNONYM categories FOR beerdb.categories;
CREATE PUBLIC SYNONYM colors FOR beerdb.colors;
CREATE PUBLIC SYNONYM styles FOR beerdb.styles;

-- Note: You can use CREATE SYNONYM to build
-- private synonyms (not public synonyms),
-- so try it out.



-- The DROP statement can be used to remove
-- the synonyms as necessay.
